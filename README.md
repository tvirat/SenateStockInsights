# SenateStockInsights
---
The goal of our project is to analyze and detect potential instances where U.S. senators make suspiciously well-timed stock transactions that raise ethical red flags for insider trading or conflicts of interest. This matters because preserving public trust in government institutions is essential for democracy. Elected officials profiting from access to privileged information violates the public trust and core principles of ethical governance. To facilitate transparency and accountability, the data we will examine includes the mandatory stock disclosure filings from 2012 onward when the STOCK Act rules took effect
# Features
---
- Calcuate the annual Return on Investment of each senator for every stock transcation
- Categorize senators into three categories (high, medium, low) based on their annual ROI 
- Visualize the graph representing all senators along with their stock transactions and their ROI category
- Calculate and visualize the US states with highest and lowest senator ROIs
- Calculate and visualize the most and least popular stocks transacted over the last decade
# Motivation
---
In recent years, there has been significant scrutiny and controversy surrounding stock trading activity by members of the United States Congress. Critics argue that senators and representatives have an unfair advantage and potential access to non-public information that could guide their personal investment decisions. Several studies have analyzed stock trading patterns of senators compared to the broader market. The STOCK Act, passed in 2012, prohibited the use of non-public information for private profit and required regular disclosure of stock transactions by government officials. However, enforcement has been lacking, and many feel stronger laws and oversight are needed to address conflicts of interest. So, we wanted to see ourselves how the act has influenced the ROI of the senators over the last decade.
